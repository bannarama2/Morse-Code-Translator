# Morse-Code-Translator
This Python script translates a provided word or phrase into Morse code. It converts each character to its Morse code equivalent and presents the output as a sequence of lines, where each line represents a letter. Additionally, a blank line indicates the start of a new word. The script supports alphabets (a-z), common punctuation, and spaces.
