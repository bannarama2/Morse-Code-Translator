# Morse-Code-Translator
This Python script translates a provided word or phrase into Morse code. It converts each character to its Morse code equivalent and presents the output as a sequence of lines, where each line represents a letter. Additionally, a blank line indicates the start of a new word. The script supports alphabets (a-z), common punctuation, and spaces.

### Morse Code Chart
Before you dive into the translator, familiarize yourself with the Morse code chart included at the beginning of the script. This chart shows the Morse code representations for each alphabet letter. Use it as a quick reference while translating your messages.

### How It Works
The Morse Code Translator script takes your input—be it a word, phrase, or sentence—and converts each character into its corresponding Morse code representation. The output is presented as a sequence of lines, where each line represents a letter. Blank lines indicate the start of a new word.

### Usage
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open your terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.
Run the script using the command: python morse_code_translator.py.
Enter the word or phrase you want to translate into Morse code.
Observe the Morse code output, with each line corresponding to a letter and empty lines signifying new words.

### Supported Characters
Alphabets (a-z)
Space (' ')
Punctuation: Comma (','), Question Mark ('?'), Exclamation Mark ('!'), Full Stop ('.'), Colon (':'), Semi-Colon (';'), Apostrophe ("'").

### Note
The script is case-insensitive, converting all input to lowercase.
Unsupported characters will result in an error message.
Explore the intriguing world of Morse code and decode your own messages using this simple yet effective translator!
